## Product Architecture

### Design Philosophy

1. **Mobile-First PWA**: Every feature works excellently on mobile before web
2. **Real-Time First**: All collaborative features use real-time synchronization
3. **AI-Enhanced**: Leverage AI to augment human intelligence, not replace it
4. **Secure by Design**: User data privacy and security are non-negotiable
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without AI, enhanced with AI

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (mobile-optimized, dark theme)
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL with real-time subscriptions)
- **AI Orchestration**: n8n workflows (webhook-based architecture)

## Launch Preparation System

**Version 1.1 - December 2025**

Launch Preparation is a comprehensive guided onboarding system that ensures every user completes essential setup before accessing the full AI Rocket application.

### Overview

**Purpose**: Guarantee proper data connection, feature discovery, and team configuration before users enter the main application.

**Design**: Three sequential stages with gamified progression and point rewards.

**Requirements**: Users must reach minimum levels in all stages before "launching" into the main app.

### The Three Stages

#### 🟠 Stage 1: Fuel (Data Connection)

**Goal**: Connect business data to enable AI insights

**Key Activities:**
- Connect Google Drive account via OAuth
- Select folder categories (Strategy, Projects, Meetings, Financials)
- Trigger initial data synchronization
- Monitor document counts per category

**Level Progression:**
- **Level 1** (10 pts): Connect 1 document (any type)
- **Level 2** (20 pts): 1 of each folder type
- **Level 3** (30 pts): 3+ Strategy, 3+ Projects, 10+ Meetings, 3+ Financials
- **Level 4** (40 pts): 10+ Strategy, 10+ Projects, 50+ Meetings, 10+ Financials
- **Level 5** (50 pts): 10+ Strategy, 10+ Projects, 100+ Meetings, 10+ Financials

**Achievements:**
- First Document Upload (+5 pts)
- Google Drive Connected (+10 pts)
- Each Folder Type Selected (+10 pts each)
