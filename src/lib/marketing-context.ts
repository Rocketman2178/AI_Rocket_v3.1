  advancedUseCases: [
    {
      title: "Automated Competitive Intelligence",
      subtitle: "Weekly market insights delivered while you sleep",
      description: "Connect your Google Drive folder containing competitor research, industry reports, and market analysis. Set up a weekly scheduled report that asks: \"Analyze all new competitor activity, pricing changes, and market trends from this week. Compare against our positioning and identify 3 immediate opportunities.\" Every Monday at 8 AM, Astra delivers a comprehensive competitive brief synthesizing everything that matters - without you lifting a finger. Traditional AI tools require you to manually upload files and ask the same questions repeatedly. Astra does this autonomously while you sleep."
    },
    {
      title: "Cross-Document Pattern Recognition",
      subtitle: "Find insights hidden across hundreds of files",
      description: "Connect your Google Drive folders containing customer feedback, meeting notes, support tickets, and sales calls. Ask Astra: \"Search all documents from Q4 and identify recurring pain points, feature requests, and complaints. Group by severity and frequency.\" Astra analyzes hundreds of documents simultaneously, finding patterns across 6 months of conversations that would take weeks to review manually. Traditional AI can only analyze what you paste into a single chat - Astra connects the dots across your entire document library."
    },
    {
      title: "Board-Ready Financial Narratives",
      subtitle: "Transform raw numbers into executive insights",
      description: "Upload your financial statements, P&L reports, and cash flow projections to your connected Google Drive financial folder. Schedule a monthly report asking: \"Create an executive summary of our financial performance this month. Highlight: revenue trends vs forecast, top 3 expense categories that increased, cash runway projection, and 2 strategic recommendations based on the data.\" Astra generates a narrative analysis with visualizations, ready to present to your board. Traditional AI requires you to manually format data, explain context, and can't maintain month-over-month comparison context."
    },
    {
      title: "Proactive Team Health Monitoring",
      subtitle: "Spot burnout and project risks before they explode",
      description: "Connect team meeting notes, project documentation, and status updates in Google Drive. Ask Astra weekly: \"Analyze all team communications and meeting notes. Identify team members showing signs of overwork, projects experiencing scope creep, and areas where deadlines are at risk. Rank by urgency.\" Astra reads between the lines across dozens of documents, spotting patterns like increasing meeting frequency, timeline slippage mentions, or stressed language that indicate problems before they explode. Traditional AI can't maintain team context or analyze sentiment across multiple document types."
    },
    {
      title: "Meeting Intelligence & Accountability",
      subtitle: "Never lose a decision or commitment again",
      description: "Connect your Google Meet transcripts and ask Astra weekly: \"Review all meetings from this week. Extract every commitment made, decision reached, and action item assigned. Create an accountability tracker showing: who committed to what, by when, and current status based on follow-up mentions in later meetings.\" Schedule this as an automated Friday report that holds the entire team accountable without you manually taking notes in every meeting. Traditional AI can't track commitments across multiple meetings or identify when promises aren't being kept."
    },
    {
      title: "Strategic Plan Synthesis",
      subtitle: "Transform scattered ideas into coherent strategy",
      description: "Throughout the quarter, you save random notes, meeting discussions, and brainstorming documents to a \"Strategy Ideas\" folder in Google Drive. At quarter-end, ask Astra: \"Review all documents in my Strategy folder. Synthesize into a coherent Q2 strategic plan with: top 3 priorities, success metrics, resource requirements, and timeline. Identify conflicting ideas and propose resolutions.\" Astra reads 50+ documents, identifies themes, resolves contradictions, and creates a structured plan. Traditional AI would require you to manually consolidate everything first."
    },
    {
      title: "Data-Driven Pricing Strategy",
      subtitle: "Multi-source pricing intelligence in one analysis",
      description: "Connect folders containing: competitor pricing research, customer feedback about pricing, your internal cost data, and sales win/loss analysis. Ask Astra: \"Analyze our current pricing against competitor positioning, customer price sensitivity from feedback, and our cost structure. Recommend a pricing strategy for our Q2 launch with 3 tier options, including expected conversion impacts and revenue projections.\" Astra synthesizes market data, customer psychology, and financial realities into actionable pricing recommendations. Traditional AI can't cross-reference multiple data sources to build comprehensive pricing intelligence."
    },
    {
      title: "Custom Research Methodology",
      subtitle: "Teach Astra your framework once, use it forever",
      description: "Connect Google Drive folders with your research sources (industry reports, academic papers, case studies). First, have a conversation with Astra explaining your research framework: \"When I ask for market research, always include: TAM/SAM/SOM analysis, key player positioning, regulatory considerations, and technology trends. Use data from the 'Market Research' folder.\" Then schedule monthly: \"Generate a market analysis report for our expansion into healthcare.\" Astra follows your custom methodology consistently. Traditional AI has no memory of your preferences and requires re-explaining frameworks every time."
    },
    {
      title: "Self-Updating Knowledge Base",
      subtitle: "Living documentation that stays current automatically",
      description: "Connect all your Google Drive folders - sales playbooks, product documentation, HR policies, and process guides. Ask Astra: \"Create a comprehensive knowledge base answer for: 'How do we handle enterprise contract negotiations?' Pull from sales playbooks, legal templates, past deal notes, and pricing guidelines. Update this answer monthly as new documents are added.\" Set this as a scheduled report for your top 20 most-asked questions. Astra maintains living documentation that stays current. Traditional AI requires manual updates and can't automatically incorporate new information as your organization evolves."
    },
    {
      title: "Multi-Quarter Trend Analysis",
      subtitle: "See patterns that only emerge over time",
      description: "Connect folders containing quarterly reports, monthly metrics, and performance data going back 2+ years. Ask Astra: \"Analyze our business performance over the past 8 quarters. Identify: seasonal patterns, growth trajectory changes, which initiatives delivered ROI vs failed, and predictive indicators for our next quarter's success. Create a trend visualization showing the story of our growth.\" Astra maintains historical context that lets you see macro patterns impossible to spot in point-in-time analysis. Traditional AI has no memory beyond a single conversation and can't compare data across time periods without you manually providing everything."
    },
    {
      title: "Zero-to-Productive Onboarding",
      subtitle: "New team members fully operational in under an hour",
      description: "Traditional AI tools dump new users into an empty chat box with no guidance. AI Rocket's Launch Preparation system guides every new user through a three-stage onboarding flow: (1) Fuel Stage - connect Google Drive folders containing your business documents, (2) Boosters Stage - experience AI capabilities by creating your first visualization and scheduling your first automated report, (3) Guidance Stage - configure team settings and invite colleagues. The system uses gamification with Launch Points and achievements to make onboarding engaging rather than tedious. Users must complete minimum requirements in each stage before accessing the full platform, ensuring zero abandonment and 100% proper setup. Post-launch, Mission Control tracks ongoing engagement and encourages feature exploration with 40+ unlockable achievements. This transforms onboarding from \"figure it out yourself\" to \"guided mastery in 60 minutes.\""
