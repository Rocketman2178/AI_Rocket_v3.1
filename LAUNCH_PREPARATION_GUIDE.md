# Launch Preparation Guide
## Complete Setup System for AI Rocket + Astra Intelligence

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Last Updated:** December 8, 2025
**Status:** Active for All Users

---

## Overview

**Launch Preparation** is a comprehensive onboarding system that ensures users complete essential setup steps before accessing the full AI Rocket application. This guided flow helps users:

1. **Connect their data** (Fuel Stage)
2. **Learn AI capabilities** (Boosters Stage)
3. **Configure team settings** (Guidance Stage)

Once users complete minimum requirements, they "launch" into the main application with access to **Mission Control** - a progress tracking and achievement system.

## Level & Points System

### How Levels Work

**Each stage has 5 levels** that unlock progressively:

1. **Level 0**: Starting state (no requirements met)
2. **Level 1**: Minimum viable setup
3. **Level 2**: Basic functionality unlocked
4. **Level 3**: Intermediate usage
5. **Level 4**: Advanced features enabled
6. **Level 5**: Complete mastery

**Progression Model:**
- Users advance levels by meeting specific requirements

- Points contribute to overall Launch Points total
- Higher levels require more substantial accomplishments

### How Points Work

**Two types of points:**

1. **Task Achievement Points**: Earned by completing specific actions
   - Example: "First Visualization Created" = +10 points

2. **Level Achievement Points**: Earned by reaching new levels
   - Example: "Fuel Level 2 Reached" = +20 points

**Points are cumulative** and visible in:
- Stage progress cards
- Launch Preparation header
- Mission Control dashboard (after launch)

### Point Values

**Fuel Stage:**

## User Experience Flow

### Initial Onboarding (New Users)

```
1. Sign Up with Invite Code
   ↓
2. Team Assignment (Admin creates team / Member joins team)
   ↓
3. Launch Preparation Onboarding Screens
   - Screen 1: Welcome to Launch Preparation
   - Screen 2: Three Stages Overview
   - Screen 3: Fuel Stage Introduction
   - Screen 4: Boosters Stage Introduction
   - Screen 5: Guidance Stage Introduction
   - Screen 6: Ready to Begin
   ↓
4. Launch Preparation Flow (Locked In)

   - Cannot access main app until launched
   ↓
5. Click "Launch AI Rocket" (when requirements met)
   ↓
6. Celebration Animation
   ↓
7. Main Application (Mission Control unlocked)
```

### Legacy User Experience

Users who existed before Launch Prep rollout see a modified flow:

```
1. Login After Migration
   ↓
2. Launch Preparation Onboarding Screens (Special Banner)
   - "Welcome Back!" message
   - Explanation of new Launch Preparation System
   - One-time setup message
   - Earn points for completing tasks
   ↓
3. Same three-stage flow as new users
   ↓
4. Launch into main app when requirements met
```

**Special Banner Text:**
> "Welcome Back! We've introduced a new Launch Preparation System. Complete this one-time setup to unlock Mission Control and start tracking your team's progress!"

### Stage Navigation

**Stage Selector:**
- Always visible at top of Launch Prep screen
- Shows current stage with highlight
- Displays level badges for each stage
- Click to switch between stages (forward only)

**Progression Rules:**
- Start at Fuel Stage (locked to stage initially)
- Must reach Level 1 in current stage to unlock next stage
- Can return to previous stages anytime
- All progress is saved automatically

**Visual Indicators:**
- 🔒 Locked stages (gray, not clickable)
- 🟠/🔵/🟢 Active/unlocked stages (colored, clickable)
- ✓ Completed tasks (checkmark icon)
- Progress bars for each level requirement

---

## Exit & Logout Behavior

### Close Button (X)

Located in top-right header:
- **Action**: Shows confirmation modal
- **Modal Options**:
  - "Continue Setup" (cancel)
  - "Exit & Logout" (logs out user)
- **Outcome**: User is logged out and returned to login screen
- **Progress**: All progress is saved and restored on next login

### No Skip Option

**Critical Design Decision**: Users cannot skip Launch Prep

- No "Skip for now" button
- No "I'll do this later" option
- Must complete minimum requirements
- Only exit is logout

**Rationale:**
- Ensures users have proper setup for Mission Control
- Prevents confusion in main app without data connected
- Guarantees feature discovery and adoption
- Protects user experience by avoiding broken workflows

### Return After Logout

When user logs in again:
- Sees Launch Prep exactly where they left off
- All progress and levels preserved
- Can continue from any stage
- Onboarding screens not shown again

---

## Legacy User Handling

### Who Are Legacy Users?

**Legacy users** are users who existed before the Launch Prep rollout.

Identified by:
```sql
SELECT is_legacy_user FROM launch_preparation_eligible_users
WHERE user_id = [current_user];
```

### Migration Process

All existing users were migrated on December 8, 2025:

1. **Added to Eligible Users Table**
   - All existing users enrolled automatically
   - Users with `team_id` marked as `is_legacy_user = true`

2. **Initialized Launch Status**
   - Stage: `fuel`
   - Level: 0 (starting level)
   - Points: 0
   - `is_launched`: `false` (must complete Launch Prep)

3. **Backfilled Progress**
   - Created initial Fuel stage progress record
   - Set all stages to level 0

### Legacy User Experience Differences

**1. Special Welcome Banner**
- Appears on first onboarding screen
- Explains new Launch Preparation system
- Acknowledges they're existing users
- Sets expectations for one-time setup

**2. Retroactive Point Earning**
- Can earn points for data they've already connected
- Existing documents count toward Fuel levels
- Past actions don't automatically grant points
- Must trigger sync/actions to earn achievements

**3. Requirement Enforcement**
- Same requirements as new users
- Must reach minimum levels to launch
- Cannot bypass even if they used old system

### Technical Flag

```typescript
// Frontend check
const isLegacyUser = launchStatus?.is_legacy_user || false;

// Database field
user_launch_status.is_legacy_user: boolean
```

---

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema

**launch_preparation_eligible_users**
```sql
CREATE TABLE launch_preparation_eligible_users (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id uuid REFERENCES auth.users NOT NULL,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
  is_legacy_user boolean DEFAULT false
);
```

**user_launch_status**
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_launch_status (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id uuid REFERENCES auth.users NOT NULL,
  current_stage text DEFAULT 'fuel',
  total_points integer DEFAULT 0,
  is_launched boolean DEFAULT false,
  is_legacy_user boolean DEFAULT false,
  onboarding_seen boolean DEFAULT false,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);
```

**launch_preparation_progress**
```sql
CREATE TABLE launch_preparation_progress (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id uuid REFERENCES auth.users NOT NULL,
  stage text NOT NULL, -- 'fuel', 'boosters', 'guidance'
  level integer DEFAULT 0,
  points_earned integer DEFAULT 0,
  last_level_up_at timestamptz,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);
```

**launch_achievements**
```sql
CREATE TABLE launch_achievements (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id uuid REFERENCES auth.users NOT NULL,
  achievement_type text NOT NULL,
  achievement_name text NOT NULL,
  points_awarded integer NOT NULL,
  stage text, -- 'fuel', 'boosters', 'guidance'
  earned_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);
```

### React Hooks

**useLaunchPreparation()**
```typescript
const {
  launchStatus,
  stageProgress,
  achievements,
  loading,
  error,
  checkEligibility,
  initializeLaunchStatus,
  updateCurrentStage,
  recordAchievement,
  updateProgress,
  launch,
  refresh
} = useLaunchPreparation();
```

**useLaunchActivity()**
```typescript
const {
  recordMessage,
  recordVisualization,
  recordReport,
  recordScheduledReport,
  recordDriveConnection,
  recordFolderSelection,
  recordTeamSettings,
  recordNewsPreferences,
  recordInvite
} = useLaunchActivity();
```

### Level Calculation Logic

Located in: `src/lib/launch-preparation-utils.ts`

**Key Functions:**
- `isReadyToLaunch()` - Checks if minimum requirements met
- `canProgressToNextStage()` - Validates stage progression
- `calculateStageProgress()` - Returns 0-100% completion
- `getLevelRequirements()` - Returns level definitions per stage
- `getMinimumPointsToLaunch()` - Returns 140

### Real-Time Updates

**Realtime Subscriptions:**
```typescript
// Listen for progress updates
supabase
  .channel('launch_preparation_progress')
  .on('postgres_changes', {
    event: '*',
    schema: 'public',
    table: 'launch_preparation_progress',
    filter: `user_id=eq.${userId}`
  }, handleProgressUpdate)
  .subscribe();
```

### Entry Point Logic

Located in: `src/App.tsx`

```typescript
// Determine if user needs Launch Prep
const needsLaunchPreparation =
  !needsOnboarding &&
  isEligibleForLaunchPrep &&
  !launchStatus?.is_launched;

// Routing logic
{needsLaunchPreparation ? (
  <LaunchPreparationFlow onLaunch={handleLaunchComplete} />
) : (
  <MainContainer /> // Full app access
)}
```
